the file comment:
-image_matching.py:
  use aircv modle to get the pos where imgB in the imgA. (if imgB in the imgA)

-nightmare_rightclick.js
  When I use the nightmare modle with a page automation, I want to rightclick, but this operation didn't in nightmare api.
  So I add some code into the action.js
