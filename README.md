The Files Comment:

The file: --image_matching.py

    Use aircv modle to get the pos where imgB in the imgA. (if imgB in the imgA)

The file: --nightmare_rightclick.js

    When I use the nightmare modle with a page automation, I want to rightclick.
    But this operation didn't in nightmare api.
    So I add some code into the action.js
